# Leveraging Poisson Distribution and xG to Predict Scores in Football Matches
In this project, I aim to utilize **statistical techniques in R** to predict goal outcomes in _Serie A_ matches during the _2023/2024_ season. 

Focusing on _**xG**_ and _**xGA**_ (_Expected Goals_ and _Expected Goals Against)_, here is the theory behind those two concepts: 


I plan to assume these metrics follow a _Poisson distribution_. By leveraging team-specific xG and xGA values compared to the league average, I intend to create a **framework** for estimating the **number of goals** scored by the **home** and **away** teams in a match. This estimation will derive from a combination of **offensive** and **defensive** **strengths** calculated for the playing teams, both at home and away.


Through statistical analysis, I will compute team-specific metrics reflecting offensive and defensive strength scores, forming the basis for **goal-scoring predictions**. These metrics will be **visualized** using **heatmaps**, providing an intuitive representation of the potential goals scored in a match. 


This project aims to propose a **basic model** that can serve as a basis for an objective analysis of a match, using a** more precise metric** compared to goals scored and conceded or shots taken as a foundation. Considering its ability to combine **simplicity** and **precision**, I believe it can provide an interesting **starting** **point** for various markets such as:


* **Broadcasting and Media Analytics**: media companies covering Serie A matches could use these predictions to enhance pre-match analysis, engaging audiences with insights into potential goal outcomes.
* **Fantasy Sports Platforms**: enthusiasts participating in fantasy football leagues could benefit from predictions based on xG and xGA, assisting in player selection.
* **Sports Betting and Gaming Industry**: utilizing this predictive model could enhance betting strategies, providing more informed odds for individuals interested in sports betting.
